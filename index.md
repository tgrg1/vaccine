**Vaccines** are used to prevent illness. They improve your body's own immune system by introducing it to an [*antigen*](#how-vaccines-work). In addition, vaccines have been in use for hundreds of years and have a long [history](#history-of-vaccines).

# How Vaccines Work
Vaccines work by introducing your body to something called an antigen. An antigen is a substance that imitates an infection. This mild form of an infection teaches your immune cells how to fight against a *pathogen*, or a disease-causing organism.

Because vaccines imitate an infection, some patients may have mild symptoms such as a fever, chills, or feeling tired. The body is reacting as if it was infected, even though it isn't.

These vaccines create "memory" cells that remember how to protect you against these infections. Vaccines are important to train your body's immune system, and prevent, rather than treat, disease.

## History of Vaccines
### Inoculation 
Inoculation was the precursor to the modern vaccine. The history of inoculation is unclear, with some oral histories recalling that it began around 1000 AD in China. It was said to have been kept a secret for around 500 years. However, some people do not believe that something as important as inoculation was kept in complete secrecy for that long.

In any case, inoculation reached the west in the 16th and 17th centuries with the first written account being given in 1549. *Inoculation*, also known as *variolation*, was the process of purposefully being infected with a smallpox wound from someone else. Being inoculated reduced the risk of death from smallpox.

### Vaccination 

However, variolation had its risks. Because it used smallpox scars from infected individuals, there was a risk of getting a serious infection if done incorrectly. In the late 1700s, British physician Edward Jenner found that milkmaids who had previously been infected with cowpox would be immune to smallpox.

Based on his observation, Jenner had an idea. He developed several experiments that determined the effectiveness of cowpox inoculation against smallpox. Cowpox was much milder than smallpox and was not considered lethal.

The experiments were a success! His subjects had only a mild reaction from the cowpox inoculation. Then, when they were later infected with smallpox, they had no reaction. This was the first vaccine.

### Later developments 

Many vaccines were developed in the coming centuries, including the numerous vaccines developed by French biochemist Louis Pasteur in the late 19th century. Possibly his most important achievement was his rabies vaccine, though he also developed a cholera and anthrax vaccine for chickens and cattle, respectively.

In the 1930s, the electron microscope was invented. This new technology allowed virologists to analyze viruses for the first time. The electron microscope revolutionized vaccine development because scientists could see if a vaccine would work without waiting for a full infection. Scientists analyzed and created vaccines for the flu, polio, measles, and others.

Between the 1950s and the 1970s, there was a global cooperation to eradicate smallpox. Eventually, in 1978, smallpox became the first (and so far only) virus to become completely eradicated.

Just a few years ago, in late 2019, the novel coronavirus was first detected. The disease that virus causes, COVID-19, was seen by governments around the world as an urgent issue. With the help of modern medical developments, vaccines against COVID-19 were created in only a year.
