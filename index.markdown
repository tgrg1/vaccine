**Vaccines** are used to prevent illness. They improve your body's own immune system by introducing it to an [*antigen*](#how-vaccines-work). In addition, vaccines have been in use for hundreds of years and have a long [history](#history-of-vaccines).

# How Vaccines Work
Vaccines work by introducing your body to something called an antigen. An antigen is a substance that imitates an infection. This mild form of an infection teaches your immune cells how to fight against a *pathogen*, or a disease-causing organism.

Because vaccines imitate an infection, some patients may have mild symptoms such as a fever, chills, or feeling tired. The body is reacting as if it was infected, even though it isn't.

These vaccines create "memory" cells, that remember how to protect you against these infections. Vaccines are important to train your body, and prevent, rather than treat, disease.
